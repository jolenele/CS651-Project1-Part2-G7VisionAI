# G7VisionAI Website - Requirements Compliance Report

A comprehensive website for G7VisionAI - Computer Vision and Machine Learning startup, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React components.

## üìã Requirements Compliance

### ‚úÖ Core Requirements Met:

1. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Bootstrap**: All implemented and properly integrated
2. **Multi-page Structure**: 
   - ‚úÖ Home Page (`index.html`)
   - ‚úÖ About Page (`about.html`) 
   - ‚úÖ Contact Page (`contact.html`)
   - ‚úÖ Sign In Page (`signin.html`)

3. **JavaScript Interactions** (Minimum 2 required):
   - ‚úÖ **Interaction 1**: Bootstrap responsive menu realignment when changing scale/viewport size
   - ‚úÖ **Interaction 2**: Create-account flow implemented with JavaScript: a "Create Account" action reveals a registration form to the right of the login form; when the registration form is submitted the registration UI is hidden and the login form is populated with the new credentials (this demonstrates DOM manipulation, form handling, and state preservation using JavaScript).

4. **Images and Graphics**: 
   - ‚úÖ Present on ALL pages using Unsplash API
   - ‚úÖ Proper alt attributes for accessibility
   - ‚úÖ Font Awesome icons throughout

5. **CSS Box Model Implementation**:
   - ‚úÖ Comprehensive CSS styling on each page
   - ‚úÖ Floating div/span elements that float to right/bottom
   - ‚úÖ Proper use of margin, padding, border, and positioning

6. **ReactJS Sign-in Page**:
   - ‚úÖ Minimal HTML with empty div tags populated by React
   - ‚úÖ Login form with username and password fields
   - ‚úÖ "Create Account" button functionality
   - ‚úÖ Dynamic form switching with state preservation
   - ‚úÖ State management for login credentials

## üöÄ Key Features

### JavaScript Interactions:
1. **Responsive Menu Alignment** - Uses Bootstrap to realign navigation menu when browser scale changes
2. **Create-account Flow (JavaScript)** - The sign-in flow allows revealing a create-account form next to the login form; submitting the create-account form hides it and fills the login fields with the newly created credentials. This interaction is implemented with JavaScript to demonstrate dynamic DOM updates and form handling.

### CSS Box Model Examples:
- Floating elements in feature cards (`.floating-element`)
- Right-bottom floating badges on team cards (`.float-right-bottom`)
- Bottom floating information boxes (`.float-bottom`)
- Comprehensive margin, padding, and border usage throughout

### React Components:
- LoginForm component with controlled inputs
- CreateAccountForm component with state management
- Dynamic form switching with preserved credentials
- Bootstrap integration within React components

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Advanced styling with animations and gradients
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript with DOM manipulation
- **Bootstrap 5.3**: Responsive framework and components
- **React 18**: Component-based architecture for sign-in functionality
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for enhanced UI
